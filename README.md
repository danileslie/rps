this is the rock paper scissors project from the odin project's javascript fundamentals course. i was tasked with making a simple rock paper scissors game that keeps a score and declares a winner at the end of 5 rounds

# challenges
* keeping proper score
* accounting for ties 
* implement pseudocode before work starts

# areas for improvement
* definitely need to plan more before starting a project. it didn't take as long as i thought it would but the time definitely would have been shaved down had i spent more time thinking of the process
* more effort needed to understand scope and hoisting. understood a lot more by the end of this project though
