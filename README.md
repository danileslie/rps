this is the rock paper scissors project from the odin project's javascript fundamentals course. i was tasked with making a simple rock paper scissors game that keeps a score and declares a winner at the end of 5 rounds

# challenges
* keeping proper score
* accounting for ties 
* implement pseudocode before work starts

# areas for improvement
* definitely need to plan more before starting a project. it didn't take as long as i thought it would but the time definitely would have been shaved down had i spent more time thinking of the process
* more effort needed to understand scope and hoisting. understood a lot more by the end of this project though
* the importance of anonymous functions vs named functions. the disableButtons function is one that did not work on anonymous 
functions, so i had to find a way to loop through my buttons instead of having them 
all separated like i did originally
* how to reset a game through a button on the page
* how to deal with buttons doing different things once a win condition is met
